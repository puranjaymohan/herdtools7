 * Test of independent reads from independent writes with smp_mb()
 * between each pairs of reads.  In other words, is smp_mb() sufficient to
 * cause two different reading processes to agree on the order of a pair
 * of writes, where each write is to a different variable by a different
 * process?  This litmus test exercises LKMM's "propagation" rule.
